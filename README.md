# Dicitonary App

This is a one-page React dictionary built according to Single Responsibility Principle. It is able to display multiple properties of the search term such as definition, part of speech, synonyms, phonetic spelling.  It has a seamless word-search functionality, an audio-button with the word's pronounciation and a section with images visualizing the search resuts. 

This project was built with the help of multiple APIs-integration, specific components, React Loops, and React Use States.
